# tidal Docs

tidal Docs is a documentation template for [Astro](https://astro.build) utilizing content collections (md, mdx) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I liked the way that the original documentation template was laid out, but the central confguration file seemed a bit too structured for my liking. I wanted to be able to add new pages and categories without having to update a central configuration file for the sidebar. That being said, the default categories are still hardcoded in the `src/content/config.ts` file to ensure typesafety for now until I find a better solution.

This is still very much a work in progress, but feel free to use it as a starting point for your own documentation site. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or PR.
